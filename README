InfiniBand Diagnostic Tools

infiniband-diags is a set of utilities designed to help configure, debug, and
maintain infiniband fabrics.  Many tools and utilities are provided.  Some with
similar functionality.

In addition to the utilities provided a sub-library libibnetdisc is provided to
scan an entire IB fabric and return data structures representing it.  The
interface to this library is _not_ guaranteed to be stable (though we try.)

Dependencies:

	1) libibmad >= 1.3.9
	2) libibumad >= 1.3.7
	3) opensm-libs >= 3.3.10
	4) ib_umad kernel module


Release notes v1.6.0 => 1.6.1

   1) bug fixes and code clean up

TODO
====

* Port Selection could be smarter when directed routes are given.

* Add "grep" output option for some tools like ibqueryerrors, saquery, ...

* Modify "first port found" algorithm to skip Ethernet link ports when the
  Management Classes they use are not supported on Ethernet.
  This is further complicated by the intertwined use of libib[u]mad.
