The Goals for the XML config file were as follows:

	1) provide connection information when links are down
	2) not rely on GUID's (a logical, rather than physical description of
	   the fabric)
	3) Perform checks for speed and width to be able to deprecate a number
	   of the scripts.

These goals have been accomplished with the current implementation.

Allow for subnets to have a prefix to determine from a node which port the
subnet should be on.  Change root tag to be ib_config??

Three ways to specify the fabric.

	1) subnet prefix
	2) CA/Port
	3) PortGUID

Expand the chassis config to be some more generic pattern.
Perhaps just new tag name?

Allow for patterns to be written.

	something like:
	<port num="[1-18]"><r_port>1</r_port><r_node>node [1-18]</r_node></port>


Allow for include files simple append xml from included file into this one.
Already sort of done with the chassis tag.

Include files are very difficult in XML...

Perhaps the chassis tag can be expanded to be simply "pattern" tag.  So you
name your pattern and it fills in the name.  This is basically already done.
The only thing which is different is the terminology.

Is there anyway to not encode the HCA-# or "slot" in the name?
	No. I don't think so.  This information is not available from the IB
	side.  I would be up to the OS on the node (RHEL start up scripts for
	example) to set them correctly.
