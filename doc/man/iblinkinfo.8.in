.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
iblinkinfo <options>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
iblinkinfo reports link info for each port in an IB fabric, node by node.
Optionally, iblinkinfo can do partial scans and limit its output to parts of a
fabric.
.sp
Finally, iblinkinfo can check the links it finds against the IB fabric config
file to verify fabric connectivity.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fB\-\-down, \-d\fP
Print only nodes which have a port in the "Down" state.
.sp
\fB\-\-line, \-l\fP
Print all information for each link on one line. Default is to print a header
with the node information and then a list for each port (useful for
grep\(aqing output).
.sp
\fB\-\-additional, \-p\fP
Print additional port settings (<LifeTime>,<HoqLife>,<VLStallCount>)
.sp
\fB\-\-switches\-only\fP
Show only switches in output.
.sp
\fB\-\-cas\-only\fP
Show only CAs in output.
.SS Partial Scan flags
.sp
The node to start a partial scan can be specified with the following addresses.
.\" Define the common option -G
.
.sp
\fB\-\-port\-guid, \-G <port_guid>\fP  Specify a port_guid
.\" Define the common option -D for Directed routes
.
.sp
\fB\-D, \-\-Direct <dr_path>\fP     The address specified is a directed route
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Examples:
   \-D "0"          # self port
   \-D "0,1,2,1,4"  # out via port 1, then 2, ...

   (Note the second number in the path specified must match the port being
   used.  This can be specified using the port selection flag \(aq\-P\(aq or the
   port found through the automatic selection process.)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fBNote:\fP For switches results are printed for all ports not just switch port 0.
.sp
\fB\-\-switch, \-S <port_guid>\fP same as "\-G". (provided only for backward compatibility)
.sp
How much of the scan to be printed can be controled with the following.
.sp
\fB\-\-all, \-a\fP
Print all nodes found in a partial fabric scan.  Normally a
partial fabric scan will return only the node specified.  This option will
print the other nodes found as well.
.sp
\fB\-\-hops, \-n <hops>\fP
Specify the number of hops away from a specified node to scan.  This is useful
to expand a partial fabric scan beyond the node specified.
.SS Cache File flags
.\" Define the common option load-cache
.
.sp
\fB\-\-load\-cache <filename>\fP
Load and use the cached ibnetdiscover data stored in the specified
filename.  May be useful for outputting and learning about other
fabrics or a previous state of a fabric.
.\" Define the common option diff
.
.sp
\fB\-\-diff <filename>\fP
Load cached ibnetdiscover data and do a diff comparison to the current
network or another cache.  A special diff output for ibnetdiscover
output will be displayed showing differences between the old and current
fabric.  By default, the following are compared for differences: switches,
channel adapters, routers, and port connections.
.\" Define the common option diffcheck
.
.sp
\fB\-\-diffcheck <key(s)>\fP
Specify what diff checks should be done in the \fB\-\-diff\fP option above.
Comma separate multiple diff check key(s).  The available diff checks
are: \fBsw = switches\fP, \fBca = channel adapters\fP, \fBrouter\fP = routers,
\fBport\fP = port connections, \fBlid\fP = lids, \fBnodedesc\fP = node
descriptions.  Note that \fBport\fP, \fBlid\fP, and \fBnodedesc\fP are
checked only for the node types that are specified (e.g. \fBsw\fP,
\fBca\fP, \fBrouter\fP).  If \fBport\fP is specified alongside \fBlid\fP
or \fBnodedesc\fP, remote port lids and node descriptions will also be compared.
.sp
\fB\-\-filterdownports <filename>\fP
Filter downports indicated in a ibnetdiscover cache.  If a port was previously
indicated as down in the specified cache, and is still down, do not output it in the
resulting output.  This option may be particularly useful for environments
where switches are not fully populated, thus much of the default iblinkinfo
info is considered unuseful.  See \fBibnetdiscover\fP for information on caching
ibnetdiscover output.
.SS Port Selection flags
.\" Define the common option -C
.
.sp
\fB\-C, \-\-Ca <ca_name>\fP    use the specified ca_name.
.\" Define the common option -P
.
.sp
\fB\-P, \-\-Port <ca_port>\fP    use the specified ca_port.
.\" Explanation of local port selection
.
.SS Local port Selection
.sp
Multiple port/Multiple CA support: when no IB device or port is specified
(see the "local umad parameters" below), the libibumad library
selects the port to use by the following criteria:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
.
the first port that is ACTIVE.
.IP 2. 3
.
if not found, the first port that is UP (physical link up).
.UNINDENT
.sp
If a port and/or CA name is specified, the libibumad library attempts
to fulfill the user request, and will fail if it is not possible.
.sp
For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ibaddr                 # use the first port (criteria #1 above)
ibaddr \-C mthca1       # pick the best port from "mthca1" only.
ibaddr \-P 2            # use the second (active/up) port from the first available IB device.
ibaddr \-C mthca0 \-P 2  # use the specified port only.
.ft P

.SS ibfabricconf.xml generation
.sp
Although not the intended use case is it understood that the generation of this
config file from an existing fabric can be very useful.  The following options
allow for this.
.sp
\fB\-\-generate\-config <config>\fP
Generate a config file from a scan of the fabric.  NOTE: this config file
is generic in nature as it does not include any link parameters such
as speed or width.  However, by default the speed and width is check against
the maximum supported by both ends of the link as reported by the hardware.
Should the user wish to support links operating below the maximum they can
alter this file as appropriate.
.sp
\fB\-\-ignore <regex>\fP when generating a config skip nodes matching <regex>
.sp
\fB\-\-missing\fP insert place holders for disconnected ports
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
0 on success, \-1 on failure to scan the fabric, 1 if check mode is used and
inconsistencies are found.

.SS IB FABRIC CONFIG FILE
.sp
NOTE: IB FABRIC CONFIG FILE support is only available when XML support was
enabled at build time.
.sp
@IBDIAG_CONFIG_PATH@/ibfabricconf.xml
.sp
This global config file is provided to describe the IB fabric to some of the
diagnostics for verification of the fabric.  This file provides a list of link
definitions which provide a "logical" view of the fabric via node names and
ports.  This config file also provides for the configuration of link
speed/width for sets of "links".
.sp
This config file has the following features:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
A logical view of the fabric is described by this file. (ie entry\(aqs are
"name" based)
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
There are no GUID\(aqs, LIDs, etc.  As such misnamed nodes (possibly
supplied by the config file "ib\-node\-name\-map" or by
miss\-programmed node description fields) will show up as errors.
The reason for this is that this config file is designed to be used by
system admins to debug problems in a known network layout.  GUID\(aqs can
change as bad hardware is swapped out.  Therefore a logical view
of the fabric is much more useful and presented in
ibfabricconf.xml
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
.
Ports which are not specified are assumed to be down.
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
Checks during a fabric scan will report active links on those ports as errors.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
.
Properties are inherited from parent to child in the XML.
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
For example if the entire fabric is to be 4X/QDR then only the
fabric XML tag needs to be specified as \(aqspeed="QDR" width="4X"\(aq.
However, any link/node specification can  have  properties  set
which overrides itself and it\(aqs children.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
.
Ports which are listed a second time will over ride the previous entry.
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
This is very useful for overriding the internal links of the
large switches after using the "chassis" tag.  On the other hand
caution should be used in generating your config files.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
.
Common "chassis" configs can be included using the "chassis" tag.
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
This makes defining the internal connections of large switches very
easy.  Using a chassis tag will automatically create all the internal
links for those switches.  The name of the chassis will be prepended to
the internal switches found in the chassis.  For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<chassis name="ibcore1" model="QLogic_9240"></chassis>
.ft P
.fi
.sp
results to the following names:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
"ibcore1 SP1a", "ibcore1 SP1b", etc.

"ibcore1 L1a", "ibcore1 L2a", "ibcore1 Leaf 3 Chip A", etc.
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Internal switch names can be changed if the names used in the config file are not sufficient.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
(See @IBDIAG_CONFIG_PATH@/chassis_fabricconfs for a list of
chassis which have alredy been defined.  Submissions of additional
chasis config files are always welcome.)
